# Real/Toy Dog Classification (POWER DS TEAM)

## Highlights
Most Thai, who are Buddhists, tend to bond and pay respect to Buddha images in their daily life; however, only a few people can remember and recognize the details of Buddha images. Thus, the question has been raised 'Can you distinguish the outstanding features of the **`Five Floating Buddha Statues`** in the figure below?' If it is not, let our model do it! 

These Buddha images are one of the religious groups frequented by Thai to worship for good fortune; three are very similar. Therefore, this work aims to collect an image dataset of the Five Floating Buddha Statues. Then, to create an image classifier using **`CNN pre-trained on ImageNet dataset`** for transfer learning to perform **`multi-class classification`** and recognize classes of the images that were never trained before.

According to the legend, there once were Five Buddha statues with miraculous power floating along five rivers. They were stranded and found by the local villagers, who enshrined each Buddha statue in a temple in the vicinity where they were found. 

The five Buddha images and temples are 1) **`Luang Pho Sothon (โสธร)`**, a Buddha image seated in the Dhyani pose, was found in the Bang Pakong River; 2) **`Luang Pho Toh (โต)`**, a Buddha image seated in the Bhumisparsa pose, was found at the Chao Phraya River; 3) **`Luang Pho Wat Ban Laem (วัดบ้านแหลม)`**, a Buddha image standing in the Pahng Um Baat pose, was found floating in the Mae Klong (แม่กลอง) River; 4) **`Luang Pho Wat Rai Khing (วัดไร่ขิง)`**, a Buddha image seated in the Bhumisparsa pose, was found in the Nakhon Chai Sri River; and 5) **`Luang Pho Thong Khao Ta-Khrao (ทองเขาตะเครา)`**, a Buddha image seated in the Bhumisparsa pose, was found at the Phetchaburi River.


## 2. Dataset
### Data source
The Five Floating Buddha Statues are mostly rare art items belonging to personal or family property; thus, the set of images cannot be collected by photographing itself. Therefore, the various sources on the internet would be suitable material as the solution, especially the Thai Amulet websites being like a gold mine, filled with Buddha images in good condition which represent their details and patterns.
